# Organization

During the whole project we had to organize everything that we were doing and organize ourselves to be more efficient and capable of putting our best to work.

To keep everyone on the same page and have an almost perfect project organization we decided to go on a SCRUM-like organization. What does it mean ? It means that we have sprints of 2 weeks for the whole duration of the project. We have daily meeting to put everyone on the same page, to know what everyone has done and know what everyone will work on.

## Google Drive

We utilized Google Drive as our central repository for all project-related documents. This includhereed sprint notes, design documents, proof of concept (POC) reports, and other important resources. \
By storing everything in Google Drive, we ensured that all team members had easy access to the latest information and could collaborate effectively in real-time. The structured folder system helped us keep everything organized and easy to find.

## GitHub Projects

We used GitHub Projects for sprint planning, issue tracking, and task management. This tool allowed us to create and manage tasks, assign them to team members, and track their progress.

By integrating GitHub Projects with our repository, we could easily link issues and pull requests to specific tasks, ensuring that everything stayed connected and up-to-date. This approach helped us maintain a clear overview of the project's status and prioritize work effectively.

All tasks are separated into three categories that determine what the person linked to the card will work on :
- Frontend
- Backend
- DevOps
