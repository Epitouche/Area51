## React Native

For our mobile development, we chose to use React Native. React Native is a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows us to write a single codebase that runs on both iOS and Android, significantly reducing development time and effort.

React Native provides a rich set of components and APIs that enable us to create a native-like user experience. Its hot-reloading feature allows for rapid development and iteration, making it easier to test and debug the application. Additionally, React Native has a strong community and a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools, which helps us to quickly find solutions and integrate third-party services.

By using React Native, we can use our existing knowledge of React and JavaScript to build high-quality mobile applications. The framework's performance and flexibility make it an excellent choice for our project, allowing us to deliver a seamless and responsive user experience across multiple platforms.
