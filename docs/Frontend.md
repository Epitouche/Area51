# Frontend

Welcome to the frontend documentation where you will find everything related to frontend side of the project.

If you haven't already, check out the POC of frontend and the comparative study documentation [here](./POC.md#frontend).

## Figma / UI

Right at the beginning we first started by making a **figma** to center all of our ideas in one place to have a good looking UI for our website. We spent around a week and a half on the figma to really know what our website was going to be like and to show everything for our **Planning** first notation of the project (Defense as we call it).

Our figma is split into three distinct but connected part:
- Design : Where all the main designs are like buttons or even graphical charts
- Web : All the websites pages and components like the Navbar or the login page
- mobile : Same as the website part but for mobile ;).

Check out our [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/design/SDi5Wr1talXN5o4wirUuSD/AREA-UI%2FUX?node-id=8-12&p=f&t=CF4lYEruvTCz68Un-0) to see it by yourself.
