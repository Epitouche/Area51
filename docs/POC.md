# POC

Welcome to the Proof Of Concept documentation where you will find everything related to the POCs at the start of the project.

During the initial phase of the project, we conducted multiple Proof of Concept (POC) to evaluate different languages and frameworks for frontend, backend and mobile development.

## Frontend

We primarily focused on Nuxt.js (Vue.js framework) and Next.js (React framework), as these were two widely used frameworks that our team had some familiarity with. Both frameworks offer powerful features for server-side rendering and static site generation, making them suitable for our project requirements.

We performed a comparative study between Nuxt.js and Next.js, analyzing various aspects such as ease of use, community support, performance, and integration with other tools. Our goal was to determine which framework would best meet our needs and provide a solid foundation for our frontend development.

After evaluating both frameworks, Nuxt.js stands out as the optimal choice for our frontend development based on:
- Beginner-friendly approach
- Built-in features
- Project scope alignment
- Consistency and ecosystem

## Mobile

For mobile development, we evaluated React Native (React framework) and NativeScript (Javascript framework), as these were two widely used frameworks that were known to be really efficient for mobile development. Both frameworks offer the ability to build cross-platform mobile applications using a single codebase, which is essential for our project requirements.

We performed a comparative study between React Native and NativeScript, analyzing various aspects such as ease of use, community support, performance, and integration with other tools. Our goal was to determine which framework would best meet our needs and provide a solid foundation for our mobile development.

After evaluating both frameworks, React Native stands out as the optimal choice for our mobile development based on:
- Strong community support
- Cross-Platform
- Performance and reliability
- Easy to use

## Backend

For the backend side, we already had an idea of which framework/language we were going to pick for our project. However, we still decided to conduct POCs and a comparative study to ensure we made the best choice. We evaluated Gin (a Go framework) and FastAPI (a Python framework), as these were frameworks that the team already had experience with. Both frameworks offer high performance and are well-suited for building robust backend services.

We performed a comparative study between Gin and FastAPI, analyzing various aspects such as ease of use, community support, performance, and integration with other tools. Our goal was to determine which framework would best meet our needs and provide a solid foundation for our backend development.

After evaluating both frameworks, Gin stands out as the optimal choice for our backend development based on:
- High performance and efficiency
- Strong community support
- Simplicity and ease of use
- Compatibility with our existing infrastructure
