# Backend

Welcome to the backend documentation where you will find everything related to the backend side of the project. \
If you haven't already, check out the POC of backend and the comparative study documentation [*here*](./POC.md#backend).

## Gin

For our backend development, we chose to use Gin, a high-performance web framework for the Go programming language. Gin is known for its speed and efficiency, making it an excellent choice for building robust and scalable backend services.

Gin provides a simple and intuitive API that allows us to quickly set up routes, middleware, and handlers. Its performance is one of the best among Go web frameworks, thanks to its minimalistic design and efficient request handling. Gin also includes built-in support for JSON validation, rendering, and middleware, which helps us to build secure and maintainable APIs.

By using Gin, we can use the concurrency features of Go to handle multiple requests efficiently, ensuring that our backend services remain responsive under high load. The framework's strong community support and comprehensive documentation make it easy to find resources and get help when needed. Overall, Gin's performance, simplicity, and flexibility make it an ideal choice for our backend development.
